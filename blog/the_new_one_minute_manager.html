                      I learned A LOT this year and with plenty of mistakes made along the way in probably
                      each and every aspect of my life. However, mistakes are no longer considered
                      mistakes to me, they are "learning opportunities" as the general optimistic would say.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It's true though, the saying that the best learning comes from your mistakes revealed
                      itself through this year. I was quite the experimenter this year, learning and growing in
                      my mind and my body. I observed people, learned from books, watched videos, and in small ways I took
                      action.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This year I know will be different. Everything I was able to learn in 2016 will now be put into practice on a
                      deeper level. Activities ranging from meditation, gratitude journaling, goal setting, writing, health and fitness, reading, public speaking, etc., are all things
                      that I have already dipped my toes in and implemented in my life in some way shape or form. This time is different though,
                      this time I have a better grasp of the importance of these things and how much they can affect my life in so many
                      positive ways.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Questions</strong>

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Why did I stop writing?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Why did I stop meditating half way through the year?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Why was I afraid of people?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Why am I afraid of failure?

                        <li>
                          Why was I depressed?
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Answers?</strong>

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Why did I stop writing?</strong>
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                I began blogging in the beginning and end of my days in college. Once school got busy though, something had to give
                                and the first thing that went was my writing. I'm finished with school, now it's time to
                                get back into it and set myself a goal.
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Why did I stop meditating half way through the year?</strong>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              It was the same with writing. Meditation seemed to become something that just got in the way of
                              my utilization of time and energy. How could I believe 10 minutes a day of intense focus be a waste of time though?
                              Once again, I missed out on something that could have been very useful for me during the busy times of the year in my schooling
                              and stressed and anxiety filled moments.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Why was I afraid of people?</strong>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              If there was anything I felt fear of the most it would have to be people. Now, this isn't a fear
                              that keeps me in the corner of the room wishing I could just blow up into oblivion, it's a fear of
                              what people thought about me. The thoughts and emotions of others influenced my actions. I would cater
                              to someone based on what they thought about me or what I PRECIEVED what they thought of me them. For the record, in a lot of ways
                              I do still do this, BUT I no longer succumb to their emotions, instead, I FOCUS on the other person rather than
                              try to influence what they thought about me (this seems obvious but it really wasn't until I read a book).
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Why am I afraid of failure?</strong>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              Let's face it, fear of failure motivates anyone in every way. Not just a fear of failure but of what comes from it afterwards, the
                              repercussions. I realized later on how foolish it is to allow my mind to be trapped in a such a cycle. If I am constantly in fear,
                              how can I get anything done? How can any kind of dreams and desires be fulfilled? In other words, how can life be lived when all I'm
                              worried about is failing? No longer shall I allow myself the fear of failure to run my life.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Why was I depressed?</strong>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              All the fears that I had, all of the failures that I felt I went through in life, all of the expectations that I put on myself,
                              all of these pushed me to the edge and made me feel as if something was truly missing in my life. However, these expectations
                              were only put on me through society's expectations of me. I guess the real question would be, why did I allow the media to influence
                              what I saw as successful and happiness? I read a very good book recently called "The Art of Not Giving a F" (the "F" is the "F-Word", I like to
                              keep things PG here) that helped me put things back into perspective. I finally realized that what Manson said was true, we are overly
                              bombarded by expectations of society that disengage us from the reality of what is more important, the people around us. I lost touch with
                              reality in so many ways through distracting myself with what I needed to do rather than focusing on others.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">2017 Goals and Resolutions (Time to Reinvent)</h2>

                    <p>
                      This year is a new year, a time to start and begin anew. I never looked at a new year to be a time to
                      start fresh, but being so inspired by so many books and heroes and after finally graduating, I feel as though I can take my
                      life back. I accepted that college made me worse, it put me in a hole and away from people because I allowed it to. Though I am
                      grateful for the experience, I am finding that the wisdom I'm learning from real life is helping me, well, actually come back to reality
                      and motivating me to push forward all the more. Below are things that I am committing for myself for this new year, to put into practice
                      so that I grow in character without allowing the fears of my life to run me.
                    </p>

                          PRAY FOR THE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE. I'M NOT AS RELIGIOUS AS I USED TO BE, BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE ULTIMATE
                          BLESSING IS TO PRAY FOR BLESSINGS WHEN YOU CANNOT GIVE ANYTHING ELSE.

                          INSPIRE PEOPLE. SPEAK GOOD OF OTHERS. ENCOURAGE OTHERS.

                        <li>
                          AND LASTLY, LOVE OTHERS.

                      WOW, I honestly didn't realize how much my goals this year are people-oriented. Well, I guess that's good. I'm satisfied and
                      I commit to these goals. Have a wonderful 2017! =)
