                      I learned A LOT this year and with plently of mistakes made along the way in probably
                      each and every aspect of my life. However, mistakes are no longer considered
                      mistakes to me, they are "learning opportunites" as the general optomistic would say.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It's true though, the saying that the best learning comes from your mistakes revealed
                      itself through this year. I was quite the experimentor this year, learning and growing in
                      my mind and my body. I observed people, learned from books, watched videos, and in small ways I took
                      action.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This year I know will be different. Everything I was able to learn in 2016 will now be put into practice on a
                      deeper level. Activites ranging from meditation, graditude journaling, goal setting, writing, health and fitness, reading, public speaking, etc, are all things
                      that I have already dipped my toes in and implemented in my life in some way shape or form. This time is different though,
                      this time I have a better grasp of the importance of these things and how much they can effect my life in so many
                      positive ways.

                      </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Answers?</strong>

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Why did I stop writing?</strong>
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                I began blogging towards the end of my schooling. Once school got busy, something had to give
                                and the first thing that went was my writing. I'm finished with school, now it's time to
                                get back into it and set myself a goal.
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Why did I stop meditating half way through the year?</strong>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              It was the same with writing. Meditation seemed to become something that just got in the way of
                              my utilization of time and energy.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Why was I afraid of people?</strong>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              If there was anything I felt fear of the most it would have to be people. Now this isn't a fear
                              that keeps me in the corner of the room wishing I could just blow up into oblivion, it's a fear of
                              what people thought about me. The thoughts and emotions of others influenced my actions. I would almost cater
                              to someone based on what they thought about me or what I PRECIEVED from them. For the record, in a lot of wayps
                              I do still do this, BUT I no longer succumb to their emotions, instead, I FOCUS on the other person rather than
                              try to influence what they thought about me (this seems obvious but it really wasn't).

                          </ul>

                        <li>
                          <strong>Why am I afraid of failure?</strong>
                        </li>

                    <p>
                      This year is a new year, a time to start and begin anew. I never looked at a new year to be a time to
                      start fresh, but being so inspired by so many mentors and after finally graduating, I feel as though I can take my
                      life back.
                    </p>
