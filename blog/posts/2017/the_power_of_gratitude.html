                      "I'm grateful for cheese." said the little mouse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Recently when writing this piece I heard that my boss' house burned down. Luckily everyone got out safely but the entire
                      house was burned just enough that the everything inside was destroyed. This put him and his family into a hotel, then in an
                      extended stay hotel while his house is being re-built. On top of that, they found out that their family dog had cancer which would
                      add more to the bill that they had already. Although they were a bit too late and just yesterday, the family dog breathed his last.
                      It was at this moment that I had once again come back to reality, as with so many of us who are level headed enough to realize that
                      we in America have so much despite the difficult times that we may go through in life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The fact that you have life is a wonderful gift as it is. You get to experience love, romance,
                      friendship, glory, happiness, sadness, and all the other wonderful things you can think of in life. Even the bad times that
                      life brings will teach us something worth while. However, why is it so hard to be grateful?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Two ideas, social pressures and media. Duh...?
                    </p>
          

                    <blockquote>"Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;"</blockquote> - Ephesians 1:16


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Social Pressures</h2>
                    <p>
                      During my younger days I would remember coming back from school and yelling "I got an 'A'!" to ensure that my mom would hear me.
                      I was determined to impress my mom to say the least, looking for ways to gain her approval. I'm sure this is a common situation with
                      many young Asian boys with first generation parents. Expectations come all around and it's sad to say that that doesn't exclude parents.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Then of course there's society. The negative effects of social capitalism, why America!?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      EVERYONE is trying to find a sense of significance...EVERYONE. I don't care who you are, there is something burning within each
                      individual all across the world that desires a sense of significance. Without it, we become sad, depressed, hopeless, and God forbid, suicidal.
                      But, I would argue, that suicide rates are so prominent here in America due to the fact that we have impinged this idea down the throats of
                      so many young people. It becomes a way of life that everyone is after and if they cannot come to terms with it and handle it, they throw in the towel
                      to life itself!
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Media</h2>
                    <p>
                      Media is like the Empire in Starwars, but we don't quite realize it. Though media is merely an idea, it's all around us, whispering to us
                      through the subtle art of ads about how lame our lives are and that we need to step up our game and live the "good life", whatever that may be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It's a non-stop world of advertisements that does something with us unconsciously and unless we "unplug" from it, we'll become susceptible to the dark forces
                      of billboards, commercials, or those dreadful YouTube ads!
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Gratitude to the Rescue (with a realization of the "True Life")</h2>
                    <p>
                      What is the "True Life"? Well, it's not the fake life. The fake life is a life all to yourself, thinking that you can have all the gold to yourself
                      and be happy with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I went to Laos a few years ago and realized something that I wish I had realized before. Nothing truly matters except <i>people</i>.
                      What do I mean? The people there were happy despite their poor conditions. They all lived near one another with open homes in their villages.
                      Not only did I find them happy, I found myself burdened, sad to say the least. Why? I just couldn't communicate to them the way I wanted to, I felt
                      that I missed out on something. My heart was left in Laos as the saying goes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When we come to realize the true wealth that we have with the people around us, the comfort that we have, the life we've been given, we tap into
                      a power that we didn't know we had. It empowers us, pushes us, gives us hope and a sense of significance. We have more than we think. It's not easy
                      of course, but even when we have gratitude in the toughest times, it does something to us, even if we don't notice it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Be grateful and live with freedom!
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>"I don't have to chase extraordinary moments to find happiness - it's right in front of me if I'm paying attention and practicing gratitude."</blockquote> - Brene Brown
