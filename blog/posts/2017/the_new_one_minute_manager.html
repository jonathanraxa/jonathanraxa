                    My current manager is amazing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Am I writing this to kiss up to her? No, I'm not even telling her about this blog post! However,
                    I think that a lot of her being so "awesome" is the fact that she follows the concept of the book
                    I just finished reading - "The New One Minute Manager". The reason why I know this is as a team we read
                    "Who Moved My Cheese" (the same author who wrote that also wrote this book and the managers had their own
                    meeting with their own book specific to managers). I'm using my manager as somewhat of a case study for this book
                    and see how it is implemented in her ways of managing me to allow me to manager me (it'll make sense soon).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this book, there were three main points, simple to understand, and relatively easy to follow, in theory.
                    I'll go over each instance and apply each to how it plays out in my company and how it affects me personally.
                  </p>


                  <h2 class="section-heading">Point 1 - One Minute Goals</h2>
                    <p>
                      Simply put, everyone needs to know what they're in for. They need
                      to understand their expectations and what is entailed in the job at hand.
                      You only get an introduction of what is expected, an overview of the tasks, far shorter
                      than what is needed to be done on the job in a task.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When someone new comes onto the scene at any job, they are given a set of tools to work with, rules to abide
                      by, perks of the system, downsides of the system, etc. The duty of the manager is to simply set the goals
                      and expectations of what the new hire is supposed to do. They are to ensure from the beginning what is needed
                      to be done by this person to be successful. They are given all the resources and guidance that they need
                      to know how to perform and perform well in the company to not be unsure of themselves. After that initial
                      introduction of the expectations and guidance, they leave you alone to grow in your own capacity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      At Gap, this is what I have experienced. My manager gave me the resources, the guidance, and immersed
                      from the beginning of my work. Not only did she contribute to my success in this way but those working alongside
                      of me could use their experience and knowledge as well to give me a good foothold in my work. Later, me
                      manager let me be and I could thrive in my work, allowing me to set my own workplace and schedule without                      being micro-managed. It has been a wonderful experience thus far after having work here for a few months.
                    </p>
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Point 2 - One Minute Praising</h2>
                  <p>
                    Allowing for praise at the beginning will ensure the worker that he or she is doing something right. Discouragement sucks
                    especially when it's caused by authority. Bringing a more positive light on others and their accomplishments will
                    allow people to be fixated on the good rather than be caught up in having done something incorrectly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This praise is generally to be done a lot during the beginning, but dwindle out after a while with few spurts here and there
                    of compliments and praise. At that point, we give ourselves praise for the job well done on our own because we know what is to be
                    considered good work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the same way, once I was praised during a meeting by fellow co-workers, thanked and appreciated by my manager, and complimented by
                    the project managers I was working with, I was motivated and knew that I was on the right track of my work requirements. Basically, I knew
                    I was on the right track and kept at it and worked hard. It made me feel good and who wouldn't work hard after not feel good?
                  </p>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">Point 3 - One Minute Re-Directs</h2>
                  <p>
                    At this point, all may have seemed easy. You may be thinking, being a manager is the easiest thing to do! Well, there's one last point.
                    Being a manager means pointing out the mistakes in a very detailed manner, allowing the mistake to settle in for the worker, then giving the worker a chance
                    to know that they are still a valued member of the team with compliment, doing good work acknowledgement, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is what gives managers the title of "manager" in the first place. They are the ones who know all the mistakes and accomplishments each worker does in the
                    job position that they are in. They are the ones who get the big overview of everything and ensure that each part of the job is being done.
                    In knowing the mistake, they need to also be the ones who let the worker know that it was indeed a mistake and how costly that mistake would be to the company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My manager generally would do this by simply saying that the "live site" could "break". In other words, the current website that people see on their computers
                    could have a flaw in the careless way that I fixed the website. It honestly doesn't seem that bad, but in between the lines it does mean a lot to the company. One thing
                    unfixed on a website, customers don't buy, company doesn't get any money, I get cut off since there isn't enough funding for me as a contractor. Now, she doesn't say this
                    but in my own mind, I know the implications, keeping everything securely fixed will NOT hurt my chances of the outcome of my job. Generally, after she would let me know of
                    the mistake, she would allow me to understand that it's part of a learning process. I can't always remember what she tells me, but her overall attitude allows me to know that
                    I am okay, that I'm not going to be fired or anything but that it was merely a mistake that I could easily fix and move on from.
                  </p>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">What I Want To Do Now</h2>
                    <p>
                      Managing is something that I have wanted to do later in my career. It could be management of a small company, manager of a team, leader of a small group of people for
                      cause, whatever the case may be, I always had something within me to lead. I see my skills that I have now as a means to a goal, to manage. That's why I'm
                      constantly learning new things around my field, learning the best tip and tricks of the trade, learning the overview of each aspect of what I do, all in the name of
                      making myself well-rounded for the future. I'm investing my brain in knowledge as to ensure that I help people grow in their skills at a faster pace in the future. I want
                      people to feel confident in themselves and be visionaries of themselves rather than worry about their work over encompassing their entire lives.
